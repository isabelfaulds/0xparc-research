\section{Two Party Computation}
\section{SNARKs}

\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item AW: SNARKS are a way for a prover to prove to a verifier that some computation has been performed correctly without the verifier having to do the computation and without revealing information.
\item IM: Arithmetization convers computation into large system of algebraic equations. The proof is then compressed into a verifiable package leveraging polynomial commitments like KZG built on elliptic curves. Fiat-Shamir heuristic removes the need for back-and-forth interaction.
\item IF: The prover creates commitments of A, B, C witness polynomials that are binding to their values. These fill the coefficients of the gate constraint check of PLONK. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic sends random challenges that give a high confidence of validation.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item IM: Bilinear pairings on elliptic curves allow for multiplication check on encrypted values not intuitive
\item AW: Didn't understand Fiat-Shamir constraint or steps of arithmetization
\item IF: Unclear how polynomial commitment process works to open values of elliptic curve points
\end{itemize}
